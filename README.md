## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Browser Party is a multiplayer online game I created using React.js and Firebase. The game is based on Mario Party where players roll a dice each turn and move on the game board while collecting coins and stars along the way. When a player passes a star they can buy it if they have enough coins. At the end of each round of turns, there is a minigame where players play a randomly chosen browser game for coins. The player with the most stars at the end of the game wins.
